## Project Description

Solution to help Blue Teams struggling with egress control and identifying malicious activities like C&C (C2) and data exfiltration

## Key Hypothesis

Using the Big-IP full proxy architecture and security modules, it is possible to configure a difficult to bypass, if not impregnable, egress control point from customer environments. Additionally, by understanding Mitre Att&ck techniques to acheive the Command and Control (C&C) and Exfiltration (exfil) tactics, that customer alerts can be generated to give Blue teams high fidelity signals of malicious activity and / or compromised end points.

## How It Works

The solution comprises a Big-IP system(s) with custom configurations for handling common C&C and exfil techniques; e.g.: DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, NTP, ICMP, etc. Profiles, iRules, etc. are then configured to look for specific indicators of Att&ck techniques and generate customer logging, along with the Mitre Att&ck technique and / or Tactic nomenclature, to an extenal ELK system for visualtisation. Additionally, an iRules LX (ILX) module has been written to do a sideband call out to Virus Total (VT) for additional validation and enrichment; this could be expanded to support other external threat intel systems. 

Once sent to the ELK platform, a custom dashboard has been created to surface the alert(s), the Mitre technique and / or tactic identifier, link to relevant Mitre Att&ck page, details on end-point, C&C and / or exfil destination, VT enrichment, etc.

The intent is for this to be able to be configured in three mains ways; visibility only (i.e.: alerting but no blockin), blocking (i.e.: alerting and blocking), and deception (i.e.: alerting and redirect, honey destination, misleading response, etc.)

## Business Value

Blue teams and threat hunters burn valuable cycles tryng to understand where attackers dwell in their environments and how attackers are communicating externally to accomplish their missions. This solution aims to identify malicious activity ealry, as well as provide preventative and / or deceptive controls. This allows an organisation to be selective about how they want to respond and what feedback they want to provide the attackers; using deception will still be preventative but it could buy the responders time to investigate before alerting the adversaries. It is also intended that this provide high fidelity signals to teams for investigation so as to reduce alert fatigue and tick and flick alert investigation; increasing the organisations security posture while reducing the operation burden upon security operations teams.

## Technologies Used

Big-IP, Telemetry Streaming, iRules, ILX, Elastic Search, Kibana, Log Stash, Virus Total

## Lists

Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa

4. You can use sequential numbers...
5. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

## Code

Inline `code`

Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

```js:fileName.js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```

Fluctuations requires an enormous amount of energy, and there would be a remnant of that energy in that space afterwards if the fluctuations were flushed out, plus an unstable environment (1veritasium). Even on computers, deleted data is not actually tossed away, by rather written over. The fact that there can never be nothingness means the universe, and anything possibly beyond it, is eternal, as something has always been around. Whatever we consider to be before the Big Bangâ€”God.

The fact that there can never be nothingness means the universe, and anything possibly beyond it, is eternal, as something has always been around. Whatever we consider to be before the Big Bangâ€”God, the universe in infinitesimal form, or bothâ€”one thing is certain: it was there.
